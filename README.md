## Building on Linux based systems
The only dependencies for building discovery are make and [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org). Simply run make to build.

## Building on MacOS & Windows
As the only dependencies are make & SDL, discovery should be just as easy to build on non-Linux systems. However, I do not develop for these systems, so you're on your own there ;)
